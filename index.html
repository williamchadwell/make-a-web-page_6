        How does the Web Work?

      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          The web is made up of a a bunch of computers that communicate with each other. When a person goes to a web page like www.yahoo.com, that persons computer sends a
          <em>HTTP Request</em> to a <em>server</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The server will then find the necessary HTML document, and sends it back to the user's computer where a <em>
          web browser</em> interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen.

          What does HTML stand for? <em>Hypertext Markup
          Language.</em> HTML documents form the majority of the content that is on the web today.
        </p>
        <p>
          HTML documents contain <em>text
          content</em> which describes "what you see" and
          <em>markup</em> which describes "how it looks".

        <p>
          HTML documents are made of HTML
          <b>elements</b>. When writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML
          <b>tags</b>.

        <p>
          Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions literally. This makes them very unforgiving since a small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems in a program.

        Inline vs Block Elements
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the what is inside of them.

        The "tree-like structure" of HTML
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          The "tree-like structure" comes from the fact that HTML elements can have other elements inside of them. This is just like a relationship for a family tree.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a browser, this structure shows up as a series of "nested" boxes. There are boxes inside of boxes inside of boxes.

      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          When you read an HTML document as
          <em>text</em>, you see a wave of changing indentations going up and down the left side of the document. The more indented an element is, the more deeply nested its corresponding "box" is.

        Text Editors (for programming)
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          When writing code, programmers use special text editors (like Sublime Text for example). These editors make the programmer's life easier. For example, some text editors will automatically generate a closing HTML tag when an opening tag is created.

          Avoiding repetition is important for many reasons...
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Avoid those Errors at all cost:</b> When programmers aren't avoiding repetition, there will be more times where they have to do the same thing over and over. This may mean copy and pasting certain style attributes into many HTML elements
          or rewriting the same code over and over. This will lead to errors when the programmer decides to make a change to something.

        <p>
          (CSS) which stands for Cascading Style Sheets. This gives programmers a way to control the style of related HTML elements. This is done by giving similar HTML elements the same <span class="code">class</span> name and then specifying the style
          that should apply to that class.
